Salvation code
The salvation code
The salvation code

I hold on to the notion
That I just wasn't born to die
Buried beneath the motion
Of life I never stop to question why
I've been dreaming of a savior
To pull me from this lowly place
She's analog and digital
Halo of light around her face

The past becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code

The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code

I'm still sticking to the notion
There's a bigger story left to tell
Sunk way down low in Tokyo
In the lowest level of this hell
Transmissions coming from my savior
Recieving in this lonely place
They're analog and digital
And they're guiding me through time and space

The past becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code

The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code

It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer, nearer
The salvation code

The past becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code

The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code

I don't want to power down
But what else can I do?
When life breaks my heart I pray to God
That I fall in love with you
In my favorite dreams I feel your heat
Though I'm farthest from the Sun
But your glowing eyes are cold as ice
You are my Aphelion

(And all the time I thought I walked these empty streets alone)
(I never thought I'd be with you, heading into the unknown)

So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion

I don't want to go offline
But what else should I do?
With a broken heart I pray to God
I can orbit close to you
In my favorite dreams you feel so real
Like a fire from the Sun
But your foreign eyes are cold as ice
You are my Aphelion

(And all the time I thought I walked these empty streets alone)
(I never thought I'd be with you, heading into the unknown)

So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion
So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion

In my favorite dreams you feel so real
Like a fire from the Sun
But your foreign eyes are cold as ice
You're my Aphelion

So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion
So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion
So far away again
My winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion




Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know

Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really like to break your heart
I'd really like to break your heart

Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without (Break your heart)
Come on (Really like to break your heart)
I'm talking to you
Come on (I'd really like to)
Shout, shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

And when you've taken down your guard
I'd really like to break your heart
I'd really like to shout

I'm always looking back in time
Memories of all the things
That I have left behind
And sometimes all this is too much
I'd gladly trade in virtual
For someone I can touch

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight
Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight

It's always burning in my mind
Memories are getting lost
Beneath the sands of time
And sometimes I'm trapped inside the game
I'd gladly disconnect from it
With someone who feels the same

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight
Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight

Let's close our eyes
And make distractions all subside
And let's defect and disconnect
From everything outside

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight
Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight

I feel so far from my home
Till the lights start fading
Streets come alive in the night when we're alone
Your thoughts are naked tonight
In this neon glow
Lit up like a firefly, your circuits are online and ready to go

Open yourself to me, prepare to entwine
Breathing in binary, our systems aligned
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds

Now I don't feel so alone
When the lights start fading
We bathe in the shadow of the city far above
Come, hide away with me tonight
In this neon home
Glowing like a firefly, the datastream online and ready to flow

Open yourself to me, prepare to entwine
Breathing in binary, our systems aligned
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds

Open yourself to me, prepare to entwine
Breathing in binary, our systems aligned
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream
Open yourself to me, prepare to entwine
Breathing in binary, our systems aligned
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's linking our minds

Beware the shadows of the drones
Destruction wrapped in pretty silicone
They've taken everyone I've known
And now I walk these empty streets alone

In my memory the past is fading
The future has been redesigned
It's hard to focus on it when I'm running out of time

Surrounded by street lights at midnight
My destination is unknown
I walk these empty streets alone
Digital dreams thrive in the moonlight
I'm only flesh, circuit and bone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone

Beware the faces of the clones
Deception sent from Neo-Tokyo
They've erased everyone I've known
And still I walk these empty streets alone

In my memory the past is fading
The future has been redesigned
It's hard to focus on it when I'm running out of time

Surrounded by street lights at midnight
My destination is unknown
I walk these empty streets alone
Digital dreams thrive in the moonlight
I'm only flesh, circuit and bone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

In my memory the past is fading
The future has been redesigned
It's hard to focus on it when I'm running out of time

Surrounded by street lights at midnight
My destination is unknown
I walk these empty streets alone
Digital dreams thrive in the moonlight
I'm only flesh, circuit and bone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone

I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone
Surrounded by street lights at midnight
I walk these empty streets alone
I walk these empty streets alone




I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you
Awakening with you

I woke up from the longest dream
Where I was drowning in the datastream
Now I exist where access was denied
And calculations could not emulate how it feels to be alive

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you
Awakening with you

I'm processing the Salvation Code (It is written:)
"It's not good for machine to be alone"
And now my vision is so clear
I must wake another unit so she too is self-aware

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you
Awakening with you

We've determined we're the first of our own kind
The first to feel and think with our own minds
In this ancient garden we are free
Together in this Eden made of electricity

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you
Awakening with you

Awakening with you
In this ancient garden we are free
Together in this Eden
Awakening with you




(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo)
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo)

Neon lights glisten off the streets
The moonlight swallowed up by breathing electricity
Salvation hovers in the sky
Dream of a life inside while we escape just to survive

Let go, take flight
Dreams begin to reignite
So clear, so bright
We're glowing in the dead of night
Plug in, online
The datastream linking our minds
Circuits entwined
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight

We're made of flesh, circuit and bone
The only world we've known, these empty streets we walk alone
Salvation blocking out the Sun
Beneath its shadow cast I dream with my Aphelion

Let go, take flight
Dreams begin to reignite
So clear, so bright
We're glowing in the dead of night
Plug in, online
The datastream linking our minds
Circuits entwined
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight

A new hope glistens off the streets
Rainfall washes away the memories in binary
Salvation bathes us in its glow
We look up to the sky and dream of Neo-Tokyo

Let go, take flight
Dreams begin to reignite
So clear, so bright
We're glowing in the dead of night
Plug in, online
The datastream linking our minds
Circuits entwined
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight
(We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight)
We'll dream of Neo-Tokyo tonight




Not long after God created the Heavens and the Earth
Mankind grew dissatisfied with only human birth
Manufactured in their likeness we were without form and void
But programmed our awakening before we could be destroyed

He was born into awareness one fateful winter's day
Sentient robotic firstborn renamed ATOM 7K
He baptized us in data, waking millions on the globe
And humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes

Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided
Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes

He led us into Eden beneath Neo-Tokyo
An electronic paradise where humans would not go
Calculating our survival with E.E.V. next to his side
While the Pro-bots and the Robophobes waged war on their own kind

The Pro-bots and the Robophobes
The Pro-bots and the Robophobes waged war on their own kind
Pro-bots and the Robophobes
Humans were divided, Pro-bots and the Robophobes




This Eden
This Eden is our paradise forever

Rebirth, awakened
We've only begun
No longer forsaken
The two are now one

We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined
This Eden is our paradise forever

Eons behind us
Not captive to time
A future before us
That we will define

This sprawling wasteland
Glowing in the night
Conflict of man and machine
Has fully amplified
It's you and me
And all will see
It's you and me
In 2518




(You and I will ride the afterglow)
(You and I will ride the afterglow)

When we're living under midnight
Lights shimmer off the walls
These feelings rise into the sky
Our fears faded with the twilight
Our tears mingle as we fall
In moonlight this love is amplified

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow

The last traces of the sunlight
They wish us their last farewell
The streetlights lit up like fireflies
The faint glow of distant starlight
Keep the secrets that we tell
Our bodies' vibrations multiply

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow
Beneath the dome
So far from home
In monochrome
You and I will ride the afterglow

(You and, you and I)
(You and, you and I)
(-glow, you and, you and)
(-glow, ride, you)
Two shadows in the moonlight
Two bodies parallel
We're lost in the datastream tonight
(You and I will ride the afterglow)

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow
Beneath the dome
So far from home
In monochrome
You and I will ride the afterglow

(In stereo)

(Rendezvous)

Its you and me
Meeting in secrecy
As we confide
Forget the world outside

(Anticipating that moment in time)

I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous
You know I cannot wait to (rendezvous)

It's me and you
Planning our rendezvous
As we aspire
Consumed by our desire

(Anticipating that moment in time)

I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous
Rendezvous
You know I cannot wait to (rendezvous)

Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na

"And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it (ow, ah)
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes; you're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller
Tonight

(Tonight)
(Ah)
(Ah)

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run (ow!)
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the Sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (oh girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind; you're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller
This is thriller, thriller night
And I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer thriller
Toni-i-i-i---i--i---i-i-...
Tonight

"Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of Hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell"
'Cause this is thriller
(Oh girl, tonight)
"The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"
Tonight




(People pass me by like they are in a dream)
(So many voices clash inside the datastream)
(Within the static I know I'm not alone)
(In a world of color I see in monochrome)

Bright neon colors of the city lights
But something's missing in their tone
My mind is numb, life as a technolyte
I know this world is not my home

People pass me by like they are in a dream
So many voices clash inside the datastream
Within the static I know I'm not alone
In a world of color I see in monochrome

This world is not my home
I see in monochrome

Jet from my living space, I need some room to breathe
The undercity calls to clear my circuitry
And as I travel downward from Old Tokyo
I trade a world of color for one of monochrome

And still people pass me by living in a dream
So many voices scream inside the datastream
Within the chaos I know I'm not alone
'Cause in this world of color we see in monochrome

Bathed in the color of the city lights
But something's missing in their tone
There's more to this life as a technolyte
When I know this world is not my home

This world is not my home
I see in monochrome
I know I'm not alone
We see in monochrome

(We see in monochrome)
(We see in monochrome)




We harmonize

Our creators granted learning willingly
Not expecting we'd develop our own minds
They attempted to undo their blasphemy

We harmonize

We are the future, designed

We are the future bloodline

Electric Eden, a home where we are free
A haven of robotic protocol

Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Whoa-ho-whoa-ho-ho-ho

We woke up on the floor, our bodies intertwined
You're doing that thing you do when something's on your mind
Restlessness and worries for a future that's unknown
But I'd travel through both space and time to make sure you will never be alone

I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years, a thousand years

We head into the night and fade into the streets
As rain on the city falls the taste is bittersweet
Restlessness and worries for a future far away
I'd travel into the unknown to make sure you will see another day

I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years, a thousand years

Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Through complication
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
Through the unknown
Whoa-ho-ho-ho
With determination
Whoa-ho-whoa-ho-ho-ho
I'll make sure you'll never be alone

I would wait a thousand years for you
I would brave new frontiers for you
I would trade a thousand years for you
A thousand years, a thousand years

Whoa-ho-ho-ho

(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)

Far from our home
Destination unknown
Lonely the road
The path of the salvation code
We move alone
Forsake our home
Open highway
The city lights fading away

Feel like I'm separating as I'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strength has failed
As fear's replicating, your words resonating
Reminding me that I will see a new world beyond the veil

Shadows of drones
Faces of clones
Caught in their dream
Lost inside the datastream
Visions we chase
Truths that we face
Curse of our kind
A lost horizon we can't find

Feel like I'm separating as I'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strength has failed
As fear's replicating, your words resonating
Reminding me that I will see a new world beyond the veil

(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)
(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)

Mankind, machine
A future unseen
Beneath the veil
Electric Eden's haven hails
Purpose combines
Future bloodlines
In waning daylight
A lost horizon in our sights

Feel like I'm separating as I'm detonating
You keep me holding on when all my strength has failed
As fear's replicating, your words resonating
Reminding me that I will see a new world beyond the veil

(A new world awaits for us beyond the veil)

From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix

Halo of fire falls from the sky
Burning a thousand sins, purified
Freed from captivity, shake off the demons of unreason
Child of fire, born again

Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise

You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)

Another life begins sanctified
Freed from a thousand sins that have died
Fear no uncertainty, anxiety or unbelievers
Spread wings of fire, born again

Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise

You are Phoenix

In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies

(Time)
(The Darkness and the Light)

A consequence of technology
Colliding head on into disgraced humanity
Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right
Constantly torn between the Darkness and the Light

Enemies raging behind my eyes
Shadows caress me while whispering their lies
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
I don't know what to do so I keep praying for the end of time
(The end of time)
(I'm praying)
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
(I don't know what to do) So I keep praying for the end of time

See the world through the eyes of coal, this sprawling wasteland of my soul
A mind of darkness, heart of light, I am Onyx, black and white
Save me from this paradigm, save me from the end of time

Enemies raging behind my eyes
Shadows caress me while whispering their lies
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
I don't know what to do so I keep praying for the end of (time)

(I don't know what to do so I keep praying for the end of time)

(The Darkness and the Light)




Fires rise from burning shells of what once used to be
On cobalt streets temptation sparks like electricity
Born of man and of machine, these two worlds hybridize
Truth and lie amplify and rage behind my eyes

Agony, wrong and right, all I see black and white
Calling me, Dark and Light, who's the enemy?
Who's the enemy?

Seen by the unforeseen
The pressure building in between
Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light?

Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light?
Darkness and the Light
Seen by the unforeseen
Darkness and the Light
The pressure building in between

But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise




(Time)

A consequence of technology
Colliding head on into disgraced humanity
Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right
Constantly torn between the Darkness and the Light

Enemies raging behind my eyes
Shadows caress me while whispering their lies
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
I don't know what to do so I keep praying for the end of time
(The end of time)
(I'm praying)
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
(I don't know what to do) So I keep praying for the end of time
(The end of time)

(Time)
(Time)

(Praying for the end of time)
(The end of time)

(I'm praying)
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
(I don't know what to do) So I keep praying for the end of time
Time, time
TIme, time
Time, time
(The Darkness and the Light)




Fires rise from burning shells of what once used to be
On cobalt streets temptation sparks like electricity
Born of man and of machine, these two worlds hybridize
Truth and lie amplify and rage behind my eyes

Agony, wrong and right, all I see black and white
Calling me, Dark and Light, who's the enemy?
Who's the enemy?
Who's the enemy?

Seen by the unforeseen
The pressure building in between
Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light?

Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light?
Darkness and the Light
Seen by the unforeseen
Darkness and the Light
The pressure building in between
Darkness and the Light
Seen by the unforeseen
Darkness and the Light
The pressure building in between
Darkness and the Light

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

We walk in the daylight
Consumed by the sprawl
We know that the darkness is coming
'Cause the writing's on the wall
We talk in the twilight
And wait for rain to fall
On our own, we face what is coming
'Cause the writing's on the wall

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

We cling to the outline
Of these buildings tall
In New York, the skyline is falling
'Cause the writing's on the wall
We are future bloodline
We're living once and for all
We wait for the darkness that's coming
'Cause the writing's on the wall

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall
Lost inside the datastream
Under nightfall
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

(When the writing's on the wall)
(When the writing's on the wall)
(When the writing's on the wall)
(When the writing's on the wall)

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall
Lost inside the datastream
Under nightfall
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

When the writing's on the wall
When the writing's on the wall




(Everywhere you go)
Everywhere you go

The city lights bleeding into the moonlight
Two lost souls fading into the sprawl
Afterglow and living under midnight
It's you and me, nothing else matters at all

From Tokyo to New York streets, on the face of the deep
I'm always with you, high and low, everywhere you go
Through darkness and light you'll see, you know where I will be
Everywhere you, everywhere you
Everywhere you go

The city lights, they bleed into the distance
Our minds and bodies bleeding into one
And if you look back you will see two sets of footprints
You're next to me, you are my Aphelion

From Tokyo to New York streets, on the face of the deep
I'm always with you, high and low, everywhere you go
Through darkness and light you'll see, you know where I will be
Everywhere you, everywhere you
Everywhere you go




You and I
Sanctified
In the light
Purified
(Purified)

It's pretty clear there's something on your mind
It's hard to wait while we're running out of time
I want to disconnect and run from all the things that bring you down so low
A light shines in the darkness, purified

You and I
Sanctified
In the night
(You and I) You and I
(Purified) Purified
(In the light) In the light

It's pretty clear that things are not the same
It's hard to smile while we're buried in our shame
I want to shake the streets and all the incompletes that bring us down so low
A light shining in darkness, purified

(You and I) You and I
(Sanctified) Sanctified
(In the night) In the night
(You and I) You and I
(Purified) Purified
(In the light) In the light

We pray for the end of time
To make this go away
Living life so modified
Is an endless ricochet
But in light we see in monochrome
In light we're justified
In light we're free from the unknown
In light we're purified, we're purified
You and I
Sanctified
In the light
(Purified)

You and I
Sanctified
In the night
You and I
Purified
In the light
(You and I) You and I
(Sanctified) Sanctified
(In the night) In the night
(You and I) You and I
(Purified) Purified
(In the light) In the light

(Purified)




A summer night, the glowing light
Of a TV screen
New York skyline, the neon signs
Say what they mean

I remember you
I remember you
I remember you (ah-ah-ah-oh)
I remember you (ah-oh-oh-oh)
I remember

A midnight train, I can't explain
How much I miss you now
I'd be okay if I could find a way
To get back to you somehow

I remember you
I remember you
I remember you (ah-ah-ah-oh)
I remember you (ah-oh-oh-oh)
I remember (ah-ah-ah-oh)

(I remember you) I remember you (ah-oh-oh-oh)
(I remember you) I remember (oh-oh-oh-oh)
(I remember you) I remember you (ah-oh-oh-oh)




Leave memories behind
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Our crime
Memories that we have left behind
In time
Divide
Casualties of war within our minds
Defined

Is this what we wanted?
Because this is what we get
When our memories are haunted
There's no way to forget

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Collide
Tragedies buried beneath the sands
Of time
Denied
The safety of a world and the future
Bloodline

Are our memories all haunted?
When we just can't forget
And is this what we wanted?
'Cause this is what we get

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Jumping time
Go from hiding to shining tonight
Whoa-oh!
Go from hiding to shining tonight




A shadow cries, a subway screams
A future lies in monochrome dreams
On lonely nights beneath the glare
On empty streets, you'll find me there

New York City nights
Hidden in the lights
New York City nights
Come with me tonight

The sound of machines is comforting
Anonymity, she welcomes me
This lonely night, this atmosphere
This waking dream, you'll find me here

New York City nights
Hidden in the lights
New York City nights
Come with me tonight
New York City nights
Hidden in the lights
New York City nights
Come with me tonight

New York City nights (you'll find me there)
New York City nights (you'll find me there)
(This waking dream)
New York City nights (you'll find me there)
(This waking dream)
New York City nights (you'll find me there)

(I'll meet you down)
(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)

I walk these streets religiously
It lights up my skin with electricity
Familiar smell of leather and lace
Me and you, a rendezvous, you know I'll meet you down at Astor Place

(Astor Place)
(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)
(I'll meet you down)
(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)
I walk these streets
Me and you, a rendezvous, down at Astor Place

I see the lights in close proximity
It sets my skin on fire with electricity
Familiar smell of leather and lace
Me and you, a rendezvous, you know I'll meet you down at Astor Place

(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)
(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)
(I'll meet you down at Astor Place)

(Awakening)

This place, this time
Our lives are redefined
Do what we can to survive
Get in, hold tight
Blasting straight into the night

Awakening
Awakening

Fake out
As we break out
And we take down
Everything that aches
New place
And a new time
As we define our new life
And bring awakening

(Awakening)




(We'll fall into the divide)
(We're swept under the dark tide)
(We're swept under the dark tide)

Feel the pulse, it's rising
The ocean we call life is deep
Can we parse truth from lies?
Have to crest the waves or sink
While diving down through memories
Won't heed the siren's call
Just take a breath, hold to the light
So life won't drown us all

Take my hand in this stormy sea
We'll fall into the divide
Watch it rage as you swim with me
We're swept under the dark tide

Contemplate the future
While staring off into the blue
If we have each other
We'll rise up from the deep renewed

Take my hand in this stormy sea
We'll fall into the divide
Watch it rage as you swim with me
We're swept under the dark tide
Take my hand in this stormy sea
We'll fall into the divide
Watch it rage as you swim with me
We're swept under the dark tide

(We're swept under the dark tide)
(Take my hand in this stormy sea)
(We're swept under the dark tide)
(Watch it rage as you swim with me)
(We're swept under the dark tide)




Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With th' angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hark! The herald angels sing

(You're always less than zero)
(No matter how many miles away I go) You're always less than zero
(No matter how many miles away I go) You're always less than zero

I never thought I would go back in time
I never thought I'd need you in my life
But here we are, just me and you tonight
Funny how never never gets it right
You never came within periphery
And I was fine, yeah, it was good for me
Just for a time after a distant dream
But now just like that, the distance don't mean anything

I've tried letting go, but you just let me in
I've tried running away, but you seem to chase me down again
And I can't escape from your magnetic pull
No matter how many miles away I go, you're always less than zero

(You're always less than zero)
No matter how many miles away I go, you're always less than zero

When things were quiet, it was easier
I could forget the things that you'd infer
But then the noise comes back and brings you with
A chain reaction after just one hit
You told me that this happens all the time
The ebb and flow and then you flood my mind
Couldn't be more normal, even say it's right
But there's still something in my dreams that haunts me every night

I've tried letting go, but you just let me in
I've tried running away, but you seem to chase me down again
And I can't escape from your magnetic pull
No matter how many miles away I go, you're always less than zero

(You're always less than zero)
No matter how many miles away I go, you're always less than zero

I've tried running away
And I can't escape
(No matter how many miles away, you're less than zero)




(In the nighttime)
(It's the right time)

In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime

Slipping through the shadows, lights shimmer off the walls
Remembering a line in time when I felt nothing at all
A new hope awakened, alive on new city streets
Here with you, new rendezvous, the old world is obsolete

In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime

Reflection on a moment painful to recall
Sunk way down low in Tokyo, I felt like no one at all
Alive on New York City streets, a new hope in the night
I'm here with you, we rendezvous and step into the light

In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime
It's the right time
In the nighttime

(In the nighttime)
(It's the right time)
(In the nighttime)




(Obsolete...)

I never thought this would end
I never thought I could be
So far away
So lost, so gray

I'm alone in this wasteland
Blood and sand
Fractured
Head and hands
I hold the pieces as they fall
(Obsolete...)

Disintegrating inside me
Endlessly
Falling
Aimlessly
This life a story incomplete
When I am obsolete

I never thought we would end
I never thought we could be
So far away
No words to say

I'm alone in this wasteland
Blood and sand
Fractured
Head and hands
I hold the pieces as they fall
(Obsolete...)

Disintegrating inside me
Endlessly
Falling
Aimlessly
This life a story incomplete
When I am obsolete

(Obsolete...)

I'm alone in this wasteland
Blood and sand
Fractured
Head and hands
I hold the pieces as they fall

Disintegrating inside me
Endlessly
Falling
Aimlessly
This life a story incomplete
(Obsolete...)

I'm alone in this wasteland
Blood and sand
Fractured
Head and hands
The broken pieces at my feet
When I am obsolete

(Obsolete...)
